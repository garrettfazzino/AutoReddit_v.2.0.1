4,AmItheAsshole,Story,AITA for eating ice cream when my stepson wasn't allowed to have dessert?,fluffygypsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tzkvs/aita_for_eating_ice_cream_when_my_stepson_wasnt/,10tzkvs,"My partner is Michael and my stepson is Grant (10yrs)

Tonight we had lasagna and salad for dinner. Grant has a portion of lasagna that was as small as his fist,  which is the usual metric we use for his portion sizes to make sure we aren't giving him more than he can handle. He took a few bites of salad and literally 2 bites of lasagna, and then said he was full.

Like every kid, we struggle with getting Grant to finish his plate, so over time we've tried a lot of different strategies to get him to eat, or to figure out why he doesn't want to. He's 10, not 2, so he's at an age where he is capable of articulating his feelings, wants, and needs. Sometimes if he doesn't like a food, he will say he is full because he doesn't want to eat the rest. So we asked him if he was really full, or if he didn't like the lasagna. Grant said he was full. We asked if he would like something else, like pizza rolls or a PB&amp;J. Again, he said he was full.

He has a tendency to say he is full, then ask for junk food 20 minutes later. So when we took his unfinished plate away, we reminded him that since he didn't finish dinner, he doesn't get to have dessert or junk snacks, but if he is hungry later, we are happy to make him the food options we listed earlier, or have a healthier snack like a granola bar or veggies and dip. And if he finished a healthy snack, then we will consider some dessert type stuff. We don't want to deny him food if he is hungry, but also don't want him to load up on sugar closer to bedtime. We made sure he made eye contact and understood what we were telling him.

It gets to be around 8:30pm and Michael and Grant are in the living room playing Xbox together, so I slip away to have a couple bites of ice cream by myself in the kitchen. Well Grant got up and came into the kitchen to grab a snack from his snack station (it has granola bars, little bags of chips, fruit snacks, etc.), and he saw me. Immediately asked if he could have some ice cream and when I reminded him of what we discussed earlier, he burst into tears. Now Michael is saying that I was inconsiderate of Grant's feelings by ""waving the ice cream in his face"" and that I should have taken it into our bedroom so he wouldn't have seen it at all.

If I was the AH in this, it would be because I ate dessert when Grant wasn't allowed to have any. But I wasn't blatant about it, and I am an adult who deserves to eat what I want in my house. Grant had a long list of options to choose from if he was still hungry, and he understands that dessert is a reward.",2023-02-05 15:01:41,13/100

6,AmItheAsshole,Story,AITA for insisting on a fair split for a vacation or I'm not going?,Individual_Ear1768,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yukk2/aita_for_insisting_on_a_fair_split_for_a_vacation/,10yukk2,"My parents fiftieth anniversary is this spring and my brother and sister want to take them on a houseboat trip.

The one they want to rent costs about $16,000 for a five day booking.  That's not bad since it can sleep 28 people.  It's a little over $100 per person per day.  

However they want to split the cost three ways.  $5,300 each.  

It's my parents anniversary. And a big one.  Both myself and my partner make good money and we could afford it.  However I think it's fair for us to pay for our room and 1/3 of my parents' bill.  That would be more like $1600.  

The reason I think that's fair is because I am not bringing kids or grandchildren.  I don't have any.  I have an elderly English sheepdog who is not invited.  

My brother is bringing his wife, three kids and their partners and their kids, and four grandchildren. My sister is bringing her husband, her children, his daughter, all their partners and kids.   I don't know all the grandchildren since I don't know her stepdaughter that well.  

Regardless I don't want to pay much more than what I think is fair.  

I might be willing to go up to $2,000 just to keep the peace.  But more than that is ridiculous.  I can take my parents to Vegas by myself for less.  

My siblings think I'm being cheap and unfair since it is a special occasion and we are doing it for our parents.  I think that they have a bunch of other adults who could pay their own way.",2023-02-11 08:36:04,5/100

I don’t know what it is, but so many girls seem to unfriend me on social media?

To be fair I don’t really talk to them but I felt like they would just be an acquaintance instead

But I feel like they unfriended me for not giving them enough attention or talking to them?

Where am I going wrong?

As I do not have the time to constantly talk to girls if it’s not leading to any relationship?

Am I wrong for not treating girls as friends rather than just for relationship potential?

I feel like if I am not pursuing a relationship with a girl, I won’t interact with her, even as friends, is this where I go wrong?

I personally think I’m just keeping to myself as I don’t want to brown nose other people and sacrifice myself and my own well-being just to put someone else on a pedestal?

TL/DR: Am I getting unfriended by girls because I’m not giving them enough attention?

Or why else would it be?",2023-02-11 15:56:18,1/100
12,Vent,Story,I'm heading in a trajectory which assures that I'll be abjectly destitute in a few years🤗,AmigosAdiosMes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/10zd5pk/im_heading_in_a_trajectory_which_assures_that_ill/,10zd5pk,"Last year I stopped attending school 6 months into it's progression, my social anxiety completely incapacitated me from properly operating in such an area proliferating with people — which caused me to almost throw up everyday before school. I was so concerned with my mode of operating, whether it was normal, that I'd be too fastened on trying to act in the most inconspicuous way possible in order to shield me of potential scrutiny from the people around me.

(I've heard that that's a characteristic indicative of autism, but I firmly believe I'm allistic and just freakishly self-aware).

My mother dealt with this through, what I now can solemnly declare as, abuse (eg. verbally mocking me, throwing a things at me, pouring water on me, humiliating me, recording me in my bed, calling me a failure et cetera.) everyday since the incident for a month. 

The consistency of this derision-campaign was subdued considerably relative to it's beginning stages, but It has never stopped. I'm the subject of mockery throughout the household as a result of my, admittedly precipitous, decision to abstain from attending my classes. It's like I suddenly lost my purpose in their eyes, and as such, routinely treat me so poorly.

I completely understand the facets comprising in my current predicament, but when you're in the bellows of it, getting out is pretty difficult. My social-anxiety incapacitates me from operating in a social environment (I don't think I can stomach going to a therapist). My executive dysfunction makes every task impossible. My depression has distorted my perception on reality, along with making me want to kill myself. 

(None diagnosed, and all have a chance of being products of an attempt to shift blame from myself and onto intrinsic morbidities out of my control).

And above all, and as a result of the prior inventory of deficiencies I'm struggling with, my self-esteem (self-conception, self-efficacy, whatever the fuck) has completely ran full throttle down towards the deep-end. It's always been coasting on the deleteriously low side, but now it's pro-actively doing summersaults as it dives deeper. I've recently been examining my intelligence through online I.Q tests, and that has been a compulsion that irreversibly tethered my worth to an array of scores.

I'm sorry if no coherent ends up conveyed here and if this sounds like a plaintive tempest of self-pitying passages fishing for sympathy. 

I feel so debilitated that even writing this is a strenuous slog. Hopefully someone reads this.",2023-02-11 15:56:21,50/100

I made it clear that I want to do it on a week night as it can get extremely crazy at the restaurant during the week. I also just like the vibe better on slower nights where it is much easier to hear each other talk. I was met with opposition from my friend X. He's insisting we do it on a weekend because he works during the week. In the past we've frequently gone out and gotten beers/dinner on week nights, and this time would be similar. Frankly, this made me pretty angry considering I was the one paying for dinner (approx $100/person for drinks+appetizers/sushi+food). I put my foot down, saying something to the effect of ""since I'm the one paying, I don't think it's outlandish for me to pick the day, if it's really going to ruin the experience you don't have to go"".

Our first two were planned. Our third was an accident and is only fourteen months younger than the second. Having two babies at the same time is really, really hard. Our first was in kindergarten when the second was born, and a new baby is always difficult, but this is leagues different. I feel tired and overwhelmed all the time. So does my wife.

Last weekend I took the younger two kids to see my mom while my wife had bonding time with the oldest. My sister was there too. I ended up having a heart to heart with my mom and sister when they asked how everything was. I admitted I was overwhelmed.

My mom said my feelings were abnormal, but she thinks everything is. Well, turns out she went behind my back and told my wife what I said. My wife is really upset I talked to my mom instead of her and that I said I wanted to fast forward through our youngest's infancy. That's not what I meant at all. Also, I would have felt like a dick complaining to someone in the exact same situation as me. I just wanted a little sympathy from someone outside the situation.

I have been with one woman for the past 11 years and married for 8 years. I feel so emotionally neglected I can no longer even be present next to her.   


I know many of you will think I'm talking about sex but I'm talking about everything: kissing, touching, hugging, talking, sharing time, having shared interests, doing something together, intimacy, everything. If anything of the above-mentioned ever happens, it is because I always initiate it. I'm always the one asking, begging and reminding her that this is something I want to do with her. I am always the one asking only to receive one of her eye-rolling facial expressions before she does what I ask.   


I honestly can't play this game anymore, I feel like a rapist forcing her into stuff she doesn't want and this feeling absolutely disgusts me. This has been like this from the beginning, and while I originally blamed it on ""we are both learnings this love stuff"", this never changed. I talked with her about all of this so many times, what can I do differently, how can I improve, do you feel stressed, or uncomfortable around me or anything that I can do for you? Every time it was the same answer, everything ok. Followed by me being called hyper-needy and that no normal person needs all of this.   


I'm sorry, but I don't believe that. We go weeks without kissing unless I initiate, the last time she told me ""I love you"" without me asking her first was on our wedding night. Our conversations are so one-sided they might as well be called monologues and I hate this, I never know what happens in her life. No amount of how is your day or how are you feeling will help her share her stories. The only reason I know anything about her is when she is around her friends because around them she always has something to tell.   


And I'm not some man child that deserves to be disgusted by someone, I cook breakfasts every day and do cooking on weekends, take care of the outside of the house and walk our dog, know how to do basic maintenance and do extra income jobs in my free time. I make 3x more than her while supporting her refugee mother and technically never see my money by the end of the month. I go to the gym and have about a dozen close friends with whom I spend time together.   


I feel so much more emotionally unwinded after spending time with them and after work than I do at home where I feel like I torture her. But I don't want to torture her, I really love her. I want her to be happy and I always wanted to be that good boyfriend and husband for my special woman. I read and heard so many horror stories about horrible abusive boyfriends and I wanted to be different. I wanted to be someone she could be comfortable and safe with.   


But I feel like everything I'm doing is achieving the opposite. I want to change all of it, but our communication is so bad that she always shuts down and this goes nowhere. And even if I continue pushing this conversation, she starts threatening to divorce me. We talked about couple therapy and this was declined as well.

You want others to care about you, and that's okay, it's not wrong to want that, but the most important person in the world who needs to believe that you're worth caring about is you and no one else.

We all have parts of ourselves that are worthy of being loved, but we also have parts that are worthy of being hated too. When dealing with self hatred it needs to be used productively, you need to only hate the parts of yourself that deserve it. The parts of yourself that are brave and curious and smart and wise are parts that deserve to be loved and nurtured, but the parts of who you are that represent your cowardice, your ignorance your uncontrolled self hatred are all aspects of who you are that don't deserve to be part of the perfect you, and it's okay to hate these parts of who you are. Just make sure you only hate when it's truly appropriate, and let go when you're done because hate can poison us in ways we can't see, it muddies our souls in a way.

I took the time to write this for you because I care that you're suffering, Casey, I really do. I think you're worth the effort it takes to improve and find a better future, but once again, the person who really needs to believe that you're worth it is you.",2023-02-19 13:50:53,37/100

Finding and building a relationship is a complex system and it requires constant work form both people.$newcomment$2. u/MrDarcy4LB-throwaway: $commentstart$Do you have friends &amp; peer groups with the gender that you are attracted to? My partner &amp; I knew each other and hung out with intersecting friend groups &amp; social circles. We knew each other casually for years. 

After her BFF &amp; my BFF started dating (a flash in the pan) we ended up hanging out more by proximity to our BFFs. At some point, she decided she was romantically attracted to me and ""made a move"" to signal this. At which point it made immediate romantic sense to me (I was pretty dense when it came to girls liking me - I never picked up on the hints &amp; nonverbals &amp; I had no idea what constituted flirting - so rather than assume that every girl that was nice to me or laughed at my jokes was into me like some kind of ego maniac, I just assumed I had no idea what was what &amp; filed it all as friendly social behavior with no deeper meaning.)

In the space of milliseconds, I was like, ""Ohhh! I see. Awesome! Okay! Let's do this!"" And I looked at her and said are you sure you want to do this (hold hands and kiss and make out - admittedly pretty tame for college.) 

She answered by kissing me and we started dating, and dated for decades and are still dating as well as co-parenting and paying a mortgage and running a household by pooling our income &amp; leveraging fiscal &amp; social cooperation for mutual gain. And we even had a government wedding to get our families off our backs &amp; to make parenting &amp; home ownership easier as well as for any medical or chain of custody emergencies.

Traditional thinking &amp; codified concepts on relationships are a trap. Find people that bring you joy and accept you and want to celebrate you. You'll find your person (mono)/ people (poly)

To answer your question, you are 100% worthy of love. It starts with yourself. Well done on improving your health. I hope you are losing weight &amp; getting in shape because you love yourself and not to make others love you.

If someone doesn't love you for who you are, they aren't worthy of you.

Also, there's no rule that says you have to wait for someone to ask you out. If you like someone, ask them out. Start casual. Be chill. Learn to love yourself and people will be drawn to your confidence. It's also easier to be genuinely generous and friendly when you love yourself. Everyone has insecurities - confidence is loving parts of yourself enough to take measured risk with other people.

I remember thinking I was going to be alone for the rest of my life. And the fear and the misery that over came me. But also remember saying ""fuck it, if I'm gonna be alone the rest of my life, I've got nothing to hide or to lose - I'm gonna be myself, I'm gonna do what I want - fuck these social expectations put on me.""

Turns out being my flawed self is what attracted people to me when I was unafraid to be earnest, authentic, accepting &amp; kind.$newcomment$3. u/FarComplaint2974: $commentstart$Work on your confidence$newcomment$4. u/hawffield: $commentstart$How attractive would a guy have to be for you to ask him out? Because that’s what guys are thinking when they are asking women out. I think alot of women think it’s easier for dudes to ask people out, but it’s not. It just expected. Like how women are expected to look nice. It’s not easier for women to look nice, it just expected. 

I see you say you had one night stand. I don’t know if you guy established that **both** of you guys want a relationship or not, so I can’t say much about that. Maybe you guys just worth compatible from his perspective. Maybe he just wanted to have sex. Maybe he thought you just wanted sex, too. 

A big thing about relationships is personality. I think alot of women bemoan that guys only go for look, but when a guy is around long enough to see your personality and nails, it’s because “he couldn’t handle you.” Don’t be that woman. You can be super cheery and some guys won’t like that. You can be cuttingly sarcastic and some guys won’t like that. The only important part is to be you. Because that’s who the guy is going to be in a relationship with. Your post didn’t speak much on your personality so (I’m not trying to be mean) that might be where we need to work on. Know who you are, what you want, and (a little suggestion from me) be proactive about your interest in guys. No coy “here’s a little sign of my interest that is vague enough for me to say I wasn’t interested if it turns out he’s not interested in me.” You can’t complain about nothing changing if you don’t change anything.$newcomment$5. u/Iziama94: $commentstart$Have you tried approaching men?

I'll copy and paste my comment I made in another post someone made;

Most men wait for the right moment to approach a woman. But the problem is we don't know when that moment is. It's so easy for a man to be labeled as a creep for approaching a woman- even more so if he's unattractive. So, we just don't do anything; especially with today's cancel culture and with social media; look at the videos of men trying to help women at the gym and the try to blast him on TikTok for being a creep.

Put yourself in those shoes and you'll wonder why few men approach women$newcomment$6. u/reddit_bandito: $commentstart$Some thoughts, and hard ones at that but please know I say these things with concern for you:

&amp;#x200B;

You have a couple things working against you. You are approaching 30, and you have a promiscuous past.  Each of those reduces the potential pool of guys that would want a serious  long term relationship.  The former because LTRs typically want to have children and your clock is running out, and the latter because LTRs typically don't want a woman who gave the milk away to everybody else with no effort but now wants ME to pay the price to get it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not impossible. But it's going to be harder, and only get more difficult with each passing year you inch closer to 40.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not concerned with your looks. They are probably OK, and truth be told men that are interested in long term relationships don't care nearly as much about looks as women think. Men who just want to bang you, or a trophy wife; they care about looks a lot. But men that want a serious relationship care more about other important things like attitude, pleasantness, matching of personality, matching of family goals. Just don't be obese and sloppy, make a little effort to accentuate your strengths in the looks department and you'll be more than attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

You just have to accept the reality that dating life for you at this stage is gonna be full of a lot of guys only looking at you as a piece of tail because of the 2 problems. Sucks, but it is what it is and the sooner we accept it we can face the challenge to overcome it.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you are past that, the first step to weeding out short term players looking for an easy score is keeping your legs closed. I'd say until marriage, but if you won't be that serious then at least hold it off for a year.  They'll move along to easier targets.

&amp;#x200B;

Second is something I see a lot of in my family, and extended friends where women are concerned: are your valuations of yourself and the target men you are chasing in syncopation?  A lot of girls complain about men that just want them for sex, while they are chasing guys that are higher on the value scale, much higher than them, and that's why the guy only sees her value as a fucktoy.   Are you being realistic about your own value, and are you willing to be dating men in that same value group? Because in general, women want to date UP and it's only become magnified in the age of social media dating apps where women can find buttloads of ""attention"" (most of it just trying to get easy tail from girls at or below themselves) with ease.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying to punch down. I'm not saying to settle for somebody below you or with glaring flaws. But if you aren't a 9 or 10 yourself, it's simply unrealistic to think you are going to be a top priority to wife up for some guy that's in that upper 20%. If you are a 5, 6, or 7 I can 100% guarantee you there are guys in that range who would LOVE to get to know you.

Dating people in your range is going to give you the chance to find one that's not just viewing you as a warm hole.  But it's going to mean having to do the hard work of vetting while dating, and seeing which warts you are willing to accept and which ones you aren't. We all have to settle in some areas of choosing our spouses, if we aren't perfect Chads.

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, are you willing to be more forward and take the lead in asking men out? Assuming you have done away with chasing Chads and are now seriously looking at men in your value range,  it still might be necessary for you to take the bull by the horns here.

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to have a mindset change about what guys you are considering. So that you can actually have attraction to guys in your range.  But you may have to start taking on the risks of asking them out, instead of waiting for them to take the lead.  It's not easy for women to do that, since they haven't spent their life since 13 years old being shot down by romantic interests like men have.

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, get involved in activities that interest you and have some social aspects. Great way to meet guys in a way that there is some other current goal than just dating.

&amp;#x200B;

GL with all sincerity.$newcomment$7. u/Heartless_Kirby: $commentstart$There are several things that may be a problem. How do you approach men in general or where do you meet/find them.  

How fast do you get physical (if you are more easy leaning, men also talk and you might have a reputation that way, but that point is obviously an extreme worst case)?  

The most important, what I seek in a partner, is personality. Are you interesting, intelligent, humorous, passionate in hobbies, self-esteem, confidence etc. 

Future planning might also be a point, if you have more exotic thoughts in your future, like not wanting children, there are a lot of men who can't handle that. But it seems that you are not coming that far in (pre) relationship or at what point do your relationship attempts fail? 

Edit: added something in last paragraph$newcomment$8. u/No-You7911: $commentstart$Might need more context but for starters, the hookup culture has all but replaced the dating/relationship culture. Men in there 20's (think top 15% which is who the majority of 20 year old woman are searching for) are just not as interested in actual relationships or commitments. 

These are likely the guys your meeting at parties and bars. The guys that do want actual relationships are generally ignored. That's the unfortunate truth.

To your post, it could be what your putting out there personality wise. Are you approachable? Or perhaps your just giving off the wrong signals. Without more context it's difficult to say. 

To be honest your not the only one in this same situation. A recent study stated that by 2030 ( which isn't far from now) showed that between 45 to 51% of all relationship aged women between the ages of 20 to 45 will remain single and possibly childless. 

Because of the disparity of dating, men of that same age group have resorted to looking outside their own countries to find romantic partners and wives. This easily can make the situation even worse for dating 

The point being it isn't just you but multiple issues you might be facing all influencing the situation your in. Unfortunately, there may not be an easy fix.$newcomment$9. u/flying-sheep2023: $commentstart$Find a guy you like and ask him out. Keep trying until you find someone who's interested. You'll learn a lot about yourself from the type of people that are attracted to you$newcomment$10. u/GnrDreagon: $commentstart$I'm definitely no expert as I haven't had a relationship either for longer than you have, but to me the lack of confidence is something that seems like a large part of the issue. When interacting with women (or people in general) I highly prefer the confident ones. And then there is also the fact that you mentioned you're desperate. Those two factors might result in attracting a certain type of guy who is only interested in sex because he thinks it's going to be easy to get.

While I realize it's easier said than done, I would recommend spending some time not trying to find a relationship and just learn to accept and love yourself for who you are. Personally I've always believed you can't be in a happy and lasting relationship if you aren't happy on your own. After all, you might start depending on the other person for your happiness and get stuck in a bad or even toxic relationship because of it. This can't happen if you are happy being on your own.",2023-02-19 13:51:03,82/100
24,AmItheAsshole,Story,"WIBTA Someone took my neighbors parking spot, they took mine. I almost called a tow truck. Would I Be The Asshole if I called a tow truck?",zanderkingofzand,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115xo03/wibta_someone_took_my_neighbors_parking_spot_they/,115xo03,"As the titles says, I live in a big(ish) city, tall apartment building. Some of us pay a monthly fee for a reserved designated parking spot, the rest park on the street. Now I've had plenty of instances where I come home from a long day at work and a car I'd never seen before was in my spot. I usually wait by the car for a little or check the lobby of my building because it's usually just someone who needed a quick spot and is def not aware that you have to pay. Works itself out almost every time. Except this time.

I come home from a particularly long day of work and see someone in my spot. But not just anyone, its the lady with the red Honda that has her reserved spot next to me, and she has some random old Ford ranger in her spot. Now I was pretty mad bc this lady is rather uptight, doesn't smile or say hi back, lots of side eye when we have the luck of gracing eachothers presence, and she decided, ""Hey instead of dealing with the person who took my spot like an adult and calling the tow company, let me just take the spot of the guy next to me and he'll figure something else out, afterall r/iamthemaincharacter"" and just goes about her day. 

Now I'm not a complete asshole, I decided against calling the tow truck on her and instead wrote two sticky notes. One to the Ford ranger saying ""this is paid parking, violators get towed at owners expense."" And one that says ""sucks to see someone took your spot. Happens to me too. What really sucks is that you decided to just make it someone else's problem and took my spot instead. Do it again and I'll have you towed. -#(parking spot #)"" 

I thought this was the most fair approach. Alerting and informing gray ranger. And letting the lady know that when someone takes her spot it's her problem. Feels like I live with nothing but selfish people as I spent 20 min finding street parking in a part of town where break ins happen all the time and I'm still spending a monthly fee on something I'm not using, because it's the right thing to do and because knowing my luck if I took someone else's spot I know for sure I'd get towed, plus I just couldn't live like that. 

I also hate hate hate getting my car towed for little details I truly wasn't aware of so I can morally live with the warnings.

So my question for you all is, am I the asshole if I get her towed if it happens again after the warning I left? Am I the asshole for leaving those notes and not calling a tow truck on one or both of them? And what are the odds she'll be petty towards me or my car based on the note?

TLDR; neighbor took my parking spot, bc someone took their parking spot, and I'm forced to not use something I pay for. Left notes that I wasn't happy. AITA?",2023-02-19 13:51:07,76/100

I'm sure someone will explain it in more detail but as i understand it thats pretty much it. viral load goes up and down which causes symptoms to be cyclic.$newcomment$2. u/Anonymous_Otters: $commentstart$Biochemical feedback systems mean that basically no part of your biochemistry is static on or off, but constantly in flux.

I'd also add that, for the malarias, they tend to fall into cycles of synchronisation in their reproduction with points where they're more exposed to the immune system (free in the blood) coinciding with the most severe portion of the fever (made worse by the preceding hemolysis).$newcomment$4. u/TheKidInMe: $commentstart$Homeostasis! This is a pillar of human biology. 

There are several systems working entirely independent from each other. 

The system responsible for keeping you at normal temperatures will act independently. Weather you are sick, exercising, or spending the day at the beach— if you are hot, it wants to turn it down. It’s toolbox includes things like sweating or sending out chemicals. The hotter you get, the more this system will ramp up to turn it off.

The immune system will also act independently. Thankfully, the immune system is very smart and can learn when to use its tools, including inducing a fever. The tools of the immune system and how it’s used is an entire field of study. 

Whether it’s the course of an illness or walking in and out of shade on a hot day, your body systems will compete with stronger and weaker signals depending on how important system feels it needs to use their toolbox. 

Understanding how each system works and being able to identify when things go out of whack is pretty much the field of medicine.$newcomment$5. u/FiascoBarbie: $commentstart$It is worth noting that not all fevers are cyclical.    

It is also worth noting that not all fevers are related to viruses, In fact, as much as you can generalize, viruses are less pyrogenic than bacteria or other parasites.   


It is also worth thing that while chills and sweats may cycle, this is not related to core body temp in any consistent way.  


One of the reasons why chills and sweats alternate is that pyrogens alter the actual temp set point in hypothalamus . So it is more akin to setting your thermostat on your central heating to 80 and setting your AC to be at 80 also.   


It is also worth noting that in many bacterial infections that cause fevers,  some or most of the pyrogens are released by your own immune system , these are not really related to bacterial reproductive cycles in many cases in any functional way.  

So a lot of people here are explaining phenomena that don’t really occur are are not occurring the way they describe.   

Malaria has truly cyclical fevers that are related to the blood levels of parasites .  

However, people who survive malaria and have cleared infections often have periodic fevers.   

Before antibiotics, many people who once had some kind of fever and survive, often had periodic fevers for most of the rest of their lives, in a way that would also be unrelated to cycles of parasite reproduction the way people are talking about it here.  The biographies and autobiographies of the colonial era explorers and geographers and botanists are useful in this regard.$newcomment$6. u/WiartonWilly: $commentstart$Your immune system has rhythms. There are a whole zoo of different immune cell types in your blood. The immune system is like a bunch of liquid organs, each with many cell types. Many cell types which are derived from bone marrow have a tendency to return to the bone during the day.  They go home. Circulating cells found in a blood draw, such as neutrophils, can increase by 2 fold at night. At night more immune cells are on active duty.$newcomment$7. u/The_RealKeyserSoze: $commentstart$There are a lot of signals controlling inflammation and fever. But one of the simplest explanations is cortisol. Fevers tend to spike at night when cortisol levels are low but subside in the morning when cortisol levels are highest.$newcomment$8. u/WAGUSTIN: $commentstart$In many instances, pathogens display antigenic variation. Your immune system makes antibodies in response to pathogenic antigens, but some pathogens display a survival technique wherein they swap out their antigens so that the antibodies your body just made don’t work anymore. Sometimes this is a built-in mechanism, such as in relapsing fever. The pathogens in this instance are some species of *Borrelia*, where it can rearrange its DNA to dodge your immune system. *Plasmodium*, the family of protozoa responsible for malaria, also displays this strategy, and also has a characteristic presentation of cycling fever (which is two or three days depending on the specific species). In other cases it can simply be random mutations that result in cycles of fever due to selective pressure, wherein your immune system kills off pathogens with one antigen, leaving the pathogens with other antigens to proliferate. The Hepatitis C virus is good example, which even has an RNA polymerase that can't proofread gene copies, effectively encouraging mutations. Your body therefore goes through periods where it makes antibodies against a certain antigen (which can take a few days), kills off pathogens with that antigen, leading to reduced symptoms, but then leaves a few that switched antigens. The survivors proliferate and force your immune system to have to make different antibodies, repeating the process.$newcomment$9. u/Bax_Cadarn: $commentstart$I can't say that was ever discussed during patophysiology.

One case which I can speak about is malaria. There, it is due to Plasmodium's life cycle. It takes 3 days for them to mature in a cell.

Not all the iron is reabsorbed.  One of the marks of a bleeding ulcer, or injured gut is that your crap turns black from the extra blood.  Indeed you can bleed to death from a stomach ulcer if it perforates into a vein.  


But even if the leak is slow:  The average blood cell lives about 6 weeks.  Then it's broken down, the iron salvaged and rerouted to make more blood.  So if you are bleeding at a rate faster than 1/6 of your blood per week, or aobut 2.5% per day, your body will fall behind.

It's never that easy.  If the change is slow, your body can ramp up blood cell production some.  So you might be able to keep up with 3% per day.  But not likely 5%$newcomment$2. u/Lostnumber07: $commentstart$Yup. For anatomy purposes the lumen of the digestive tract is external the body(debatable I am sure). It’s a bit confusing but kinda makes sense considering the anus and mouth both open to the external environment. If you think about it a step further you also have blood in an area where it cannot deliver oxygen and remove waste, rather it gets digested. At this point the blood is not doing it job and the person can be considered anemic because low Blood levels are based of serum concentration.$newcomment$3. u/LivingDegree: $commentstart$Yes! This is actually how you can pick up on chronic internal bleeding within the digestive tract (along with constitutional systems like black tarry stools/dark stools); it’s called anemia of chronic disease. You see this occur in your inflammatory bowel diseases. On routine labs you can see an anemia and it clues you into a long term inflammatory process if you can rule out diet deficiency or other hematological pathologies.$newcomment$4. u/buddha3434: $commentstart$GI tract, yes, the blood will mostly leave your body. Other “internal” bleeding (say, subcutaneous hematoma from trauma to a blood vessel), you can become anemic but the iron is mostly reabsorbed, so you will not be iron deficient.$newcomment$5. u/grewupnointernetmom: $commentstart$Yes you would still have anemia, dependent upon the rate of the bleed. The lost blood won’t be oxygenated and returned to the tissues, the pump (heart) will have to speed up to try to compensate, and other organs such as the kidneys, the brain, etc., will suffer temporary or perhaps permanent damage from a lack of sufficient blood supply.",2023-02-19 14:45:22,2/100

She wants me to be excited for our child, but I know we can't afford to feed them. She hasn't done the math, but I have. We will lose our child, either to their death or CPS.

My only hope is that she miscarries so we can afford to finish college and actually buy a place of our own. I know that sucks, but it's the only way.

If we have the baby now... we will never graduate. Tens of thousands of dollars of debt will be for nothing, and a life will be brought into this world without enough money to feed and cloth them, let alone keep a roof over our heads.

I really want to start a family with her, but not now; it's a lost cause right now due to our situation. To make matters worse, I don't believe that either of us are mentally stable enough to raise a child. We both have panic attacks and PTSD flashbacks weekly, and our living space is awful. I don't see how we will succeed even if our financial situation improves.

The average person does not know the current laws that govern them, nor do they understand laws passed in their lifetime to do the same. People need to read and understand what their elected legislators are doing to their lives in the name of “national security”.

But, the legislators are also playing dirty. Laws should be five pages, max. If it takes more than 5000 words to say it then you’re trying to hide something within.

Everyone was up in arms a year ago about how the Canadian government was handling the truckers, and they were right to be mad. The means used by the Canadian government were tyrannical. Spying on people, freezing bank accounts and demanding private finance do the same, arrests without warrant, etc.

Americans denounced this governmental activity and were appalled at a system that would allow this. Many didn’t realize that we’ve been living under a government that has legally reserved the right to do the same things since the signing of the Patriot Act.

The constitution is a document written by the people for the people, in which they willingly give some of their power to a government for their benefit with the understanding that if it is misused then it will be taken back. We always have the power. Know what your government is doing. Understand the law. Use your vote. Be involved with politics.

A great non nude pic of a guy makes my mind do hurdles thinking about nudes (and other bad, bad things). This is often just straight up a win over any actual nude was trying to accomplish.

That said, it doesn't mean all buttoned up and straight forward boring. A state of half undress, or maybe even in the middle of getting dressed. I can watch guys put on and take off suit jackets (in a smooth way, don't be fumbling with a sleeve) for hours.

Some other random musings (which can still apply to nudes), as I find guys take terrible pictures:

* Poses that highlight the shoulders. This usually means a backshot (can't see your face, or maybe you're looking sideways for a side profile). You'll see this on action movie posters a lot. I like men who are natural leaders. If I'm following your leadership, there will be times I'm literally following you---your back is my POV while you trail blaze.
* Lighting, specifically extreme light and dark. This usually can be seen when you're by a window, a glass door, where natural light floods in on one side.
* Clothing, and specific 'goal/task' related clothing. Uniforms. Tools hanging on the belt. Suits with color coordinated ties and shirts. I put goal/task because I find it mesmerizing if the guy is making some sort of attire adjustment. Adjusting caps, securing fits of the watch, the shirt cuff, etc. It's like I'm in on a secret---I get to peek at the moment right before he's 'ready' to go about his day.
* And finally, if it has to be a dick pic, you have to help your buddy look his best. Know if you are a grower or a show-er, and adjust accordingly. Maybe in the photo have some object that can be 'eye measured' to get a sense of your proportions. I've seen pics where guys just hold their buddy next to a can of Monster. Maybe not that blatant. But if you're standing near a table, a bottle or a glass of water on the table can be placed among other things. At the very least, you might have the satisfaction that some woman out there is thinking about you for a brief moment the next time she's gripping a bottle of water.$newcomment$2. u/GeorgianPeaches: $commentstart$r/themaleform gives good ideas, but mostly good angles that shows the muscles, lighting hitting the right spots.

The death grip is weird.

Do not take pictures seating on a toilet.

Good light would save 90% of all bad dickpic I ever received. Take the pics in front of a window with light white curtains, or several soft lamps.

There's more than one angle, from the bottom showing the balls is super hot for me. But showing the body is also very hot.

Try different positions, standing up, manspreading on a sofa or office chair can very hot. I'm usually not into fake unpretentious lifting a shirt pics.

Tide up the place. Messy rooms can be distracting.

Soft dickpics can be hot too, for me, a soft uncut dick is one of the hottest things ever.

Invest in some good and sexy underwear. Not just the classic and boring ones like Hugo Boss, Versace, Empório Armani or Calvin Klein. Others like N2N, BOX, Bench/Body, Charlie, Rufskin, Andrew Christian, some of those are usually related to gays, but they do look better. I know thongs can be too much for some, I love it guys in manly thongs. Jock straps are the best for me.

VPL, wet shorts, transparent and see through, side pants bulge, dick print and freeballing gets me horny easily. Spandex too, like singlets and wrestling singlets. Speedos are always great.

I like the shoulders and chest of a guy, show it! Even on chubby guys.$newcomment$5. u/throwawayforbaes: $commentstart$1. Go to the r/ladybonersgw sub and look at the posters that get the most votes.

Some of them are really touchy-feely. I have PTSD, and don't like to be touched very much. One day, one of the individuals reached over to poke me. I just stepped out of arms reach, a reaction my therapist would have been proud of. However, my coworker, Francis, got really mad at me. ""He just wanted to hold your hand! You probably hurt his feelings!"" I tried calmly explaining to her. ""With respect, I don't like being touched. It has to do with PTSD."" She said. ""That's not good for this job;"" She continued to be cold towards be, and even screamed at me until I was reduced to tears. My boss had to intervene.
I was in and out of the hospital on and off throughout the year behavior health issues, and missed a lot of work. When I returned, after I got my first car, I got permission from HR to start bringing my service dog, Baby to work. Before that, I set a rule that the individuals could pet her, as long as they ask permission first. One day I was helping a wheelchair-bound individual in the bathroom and left Baby outside. When I came out, another individual was petting Baby. I reminded her of the rule. ""Susan, remember, you need to ask before petting Baby."" And Francis told her ""You're okay Susan, you can pet her.""
Francis started telling everyone that I was a terrible worker. I hardly ever show up to work, I am rude to the individuals and never let them pet my dog. She even went to HR. I couldn't stand it anymore. I quit that job. Did I do the wrong thing, not letting the individual touch me? Or let them pet my service dog?",2023-02-28 23:14:59,76/100

Growing up, ""low end"" meant small homes that were not well upkept, with little attention to asthetics or anything else. Cheaper homes were either more rural (and thus had a long drive to get anywhere) or in high-crime areas, and thus were at more risk for burglary.

""Low-end housing"" back east could mean something like public housing projects, or very cheap apartments. Usually still not very well taken care of.

They're not called that, but some infamous public housing projects in big cities like [Queensbridge in New York City](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D30OczPW4AEc7Se?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096) or [Parkway Gardens in Chicago](https://storage.googleapis.com/clio-images/2920_E0Mhv5bVcAI6QDS.jpg) are somewhat reminiscent.

These aren't the absolute lowest-end of residential, but they're sort of ""entry-level"" if that makes sense.

A lot of times, ""low-end"" residential in the US also has to do with the location more than the housing itself. [The neighborhood I went to middle school in was very poor](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.7727164,-78.6329755,3a,75y,69.63h,81.71t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sMWw5q5cMIk0cL84L0ocKxQ!2e0!5s20070901T000000!7i3328!8i1664), so even though it's almost all freestanding houses, the property values were very low.

It's since been extensively gentrified because the city has a housing crisis, which unfortunately has displaced most of the community that lived there back when I went to school there. So now the property values are much much higher even though the housing types are roughly the same (although almost everything there has been either renovated or completely rebuilt these days -- you can see it if you click through the street view from now and from the early 2000s).$newcomment$8. u/bigRalreadyexists: $commentstart$This does not apply to big cities, but I think that you’d be most surprised at the amount of land that some low income people have available. 

This does not mean that they own the land, but it’s fairly common to see houses that are in very rough shape with residents hovering near the poverty line sitting on a large piece of land. In rural areas, they may have acres or an entire farm. 

And even in smaller towns or cities, there are plenty of low income residents that have a driveway to park their cars, a front yard, and a backyard. 

It’s a big country and in some (but definitely not all) areas, land is widely available.$newcomment$9. u/boulevardofdef: $commentstart$The Helsinki street view doesn't look bad to me. Those buildings would be pretty sought after and quite expensive in New York. (No idea what they're like inside, of course.)

She has literally been the ultimate roommate from hell. I recently contacted an attorney to help me break my lease so I can get out of here.

Today I went into the living room to get a fiber bar. Found out that my huge stash ($50) was ""missing"". In a rage, I sent the apartment another email, informing them of the new thing my roommate had done. I vented to a couple of friends, too.

Went back only to find out the items were in a different box. And *I* had moved it. Not her.

So I emailed the apartment, telling them I was incorrect and my roommate just moved the box. But she hadn't. I had. So not only did I at first make a giant accusation and was incorrect about it...But when I ""corrected"" it, I still ended up using a different lie. Just because it sucks to admit that this had been 100% my own fault, I felt like making it seem less bad, like I was less responsible for my own fuckup.

And yet I'm still this kind of person who chooses to lie, when lying is something I hate the most.

Edit: I am in student living. I was assigned this roommate. We pay by the room. I am trying to transfer units, but they are charging me $960 in fees to do so, which is insane (rent is $400/month but would go up to $450, too). I'd like to either transfer or break my lease entirely so I can find a new place to live.

I have video evidence of my roommate threatening to beat the shit out of me and throwing a drink on me. The amount of lease violations warrants having my fees waived to transfer units. The apartment complex told me they would be evicting my roommate, then they did not follow through (this was before my roommate threatened violence against me).",2023-03-02 23:46:01,1/100

But from my very limited knowledge of planetary geology:

The minerals present on a planet depend a lot on what's going on inside the planet and how it formed. Planets with volcanic activity (e.g. Mars) will have igneous rocks whereas planets without probably won't; some minerals like olivine can be produced inside a planet but may chemically weather to other minerals depending on the atmosphere if there is any. But you find olivine on many planets and in meteorites, and it's the same mineral as the one you find on earth. Also some minerals need water to form - hydrated minerals found on mars can be indicators of past water in that area. Afaik the temperature (in the weather sense, not talking about volcanoes etc) in a region doesn't have much direct impact on minerals but can have a big impact on soils because it affects what life does, and that's the big uncertainty in your question about other planets.

* You'll be promoted twice in the first year, provided you don't screw up too badly
* 30 days paid vacation per year, accumulating at 2.5 days a month
* steady pay; you'll know what you'll be getting from paycheck to paycheck
* housing allowance commensurate with the cost of living for your area (while on a shore assignment); extra pay when you're at sea
* extra pay for food if you aren't living in the barracks on base
* paid to get into and stay in shape; also paid during training
* healthcare for you and your dependents is covered
* tuition assistance while you're in, GI Bill when you're out, in addition to other veterans benefits

Cons:

* The Navy has the most overbloated bureaucracy of any of the armed forces
* You, a grown ass human being, will find yourself having to put on a ridiculous looking uniform for inspection where something literally a millimeter off could cost you your weekend
* You can't say ""fuck this job"" and quit
* Your contract can be involuntarily extended in a time of emergency (as a lot of people found out after 9/11)
* If you join, you're making an 8 year committment, regardless of your contract length. If you only do four years and get out, they can call your ass back in until you hit that 8 year mark (as many *more* people found out after 9/11)
* If somebody barely a couple of years older than you tells you to clean the toilets, you're cleaning the toilets and will get in legal trouble if you refuse (violation of the UCMJ constitutes committing a federal crime)
* Your time off isn't your time off; it's a pass granted to you by the commanding officer, and they can revoke it at any time.
* There's no such thing as overtime or holiday pay

Cons: Basic training sucks, you might get stuck on a ship with a tiny room and awful WiFi, yearly or twice yearly physical fitness tests, lots of bureaucracy with paperwork and stuff, military rank structure is strict and you have to respect your superiors no matter what, pay might be steady but it's still shit, if you don't like the work you can't find another job, if you don't like your coworkers you can't find another job, if you don't like your boss you can't find another job and in some cases if your boss doesn't like you that much they can ruin your chances to get moved to another office or just ruin your promotion eligibility, a lot of people you dislike you won't even dislike because they're malicious you'll just dislike them for being stupid, you might get job experience but if you get stuck doing something that's not marketable then you've got years of experience doing something that no civilian job wants to hire you to do.

You can learn how to fit in and work as part of a team… and whatever your job is be assured that it is important.

Cons (my son 22 just finished his Army service and ETS’d a couple months ago) are the mental shift required to work a job you may not enjoy for people that may not have any business managing anyone managing you essentially for very little to no money while enjoying living conditions that are similar to that of a third world country. He was most disappointed that he was not given opportunities to advance unless he really asserted himself, and that is not what his life was like before service. His hard work was not recognized, he was just another soldier, and for some that is a huge issue and causes distress and unhappiness.$newcomment$8. u/ACrispPickle: $commentstart$Pro - it’s the Navy

Compared to the Army, the Navy offers easier training and better bases. You will tend to be stationed at pleasant seaside bases like San Diego or Virginia Beach instead of inland dumps like Fort Bliss or Fort Drum. 

For any branch of the military, you will encounter absurdity. This can be amusing or disheartening, depending on your attitude. 

Do you like living through crazy shit? If so, you will get some great stories to tell. If not, you will be traumatized. Either way, it will probably make you a tougher person. Whatever horrible shit happens to you for the rest of your life, you can smile and think ""well at least its not as bad as that one time back when I was in the military...""

And the benefits are good: GI bill etc.",2023-03-31 19:01:09,90/100

Alas, it's one of those things that's so hard to put into words.

Suffice to say that they look very good on some women and they look terrible on other women.  The only thing I can maybe qualify that is something along the lines of, ""If it looks like it was difficult for you to get into those jeans, it probably looks bad.""  That's not to say that I'm against women with an ass.  Oh no!  Sir Mixalot was on the right track.  Rather, that's to say that in a lot of cases I look a woman in tight jeans and find myself thinking, ""Does it take half an hour for her to get dressed in the morning?  How much talc did it take to get her leg in there?"" and similar thoughts.  Such thoughts are not inherently sexy and... Well, that's where you get into ""looks terrible"" territory even if you may have a nice bod.

The apartment complex evicted us without notice or reason, and we were lost on what to do, so we just took it and left. My MIL was nice enough to let us move in, but its been taking a toll on my mental health. 

Any sane person demands rent, it's just confusing to be snapped at about lounging around her house when we should be moved out. No one wants to clean up after one another, so I've actually had to tell my husband to help out. It throws me a bit, though, when her boyfriend snaps at us to do dishes we didn't dirty. I understand she may not have time to care for her pets, it just makes me feel weird when we do spend time with them and get snapped at for them being out/inside. 

We do save, but she asks us for rent twice a month so sometimes it pulls away from savings. Its not all the time, but she just tells us its rent and she doesn't need it for anything specific. The amount changes a lot too, but landlords are entitled to that.

I just feel like we're never gonna get out at this rate, especially when my husband still has a car payment. I don't know what to do, and its affecting me greatly to the point where Not Being Around seems way easier than trying to move out.",2023-04-02 13:47:42,77/100

I'm sad we will never reminesce or even speak again, but I can cherish them by myself. I hope you can too.

Your mum is an adult. She should learn to look after herself.$newcomment$3. u/linzava: $commentstart$NTA, you have many valid reasons for being upfront about this hypothetical future, her holding you to a yes being the main one. She's an adult who needs to manage this potential future on her own, you just know that your entire life will be either verbal and emotional abuse or serving her if she moves in. Next time your aunts tell you you're being mean, tell them they can offer her a room if they're so concerned and the issue would be solved. Additionally, you would be doing her no favors with false hope. Stay strong, my mom's the same way and she's moving in with me when hell freezes over.$newcomment$4. u/DorkOnTheTrolley: $commentstart$NTA - additionally if she’s incapable of doing most anything, I don’t know if she can be considered a functioning alcoholic.

So yeah, even agreeing to hypothetically let an alcoholic incapable of caring for herself come to live with you is just not a good idea. You don’t want to let there be any wiggle room. Leave zero ambiguity.

If your aunts are so concerned about her mental state, *they* can offer for her to live with them.$newcomment$5. u/Sajem: $commentstart$NTA you don't need to be a replacement carer if your dad dies before your mum.

If your aunties continue to give you grief, tell them to volunteer to look after her, better still, next time your mum comes up with her hypothetical, tell her that you're sure that your aunties would love to look after.$newcomment$6. u/Garamon7: $commentstart$NTA

Your mum needs a reality check. And

&gt;if dad passes before she does, and I’ll teach the basic life skills she needs to look after herself

Sorry, but why can't she learn when he is still alive? If she's not willing to do it now there is no way she'll change. First she will be grieving. 

After that she'll pretend she's trying, but in ""it's soooo hard and makes me unhappy, it's basically an abuse"" way. And then she'll become an old lady, who needs help with everything, because it's child's duty to take care of helpless parent...

And one more thing: what would happen if your father's health deteriorates and he needs help, maybe for a long time?$newcomment$7. u/Rigpa_Dakota: $commentstart$NTA. Your aunts can ""hypothetically"" take her in.$newcomment$8. u/bluebearb: $commentstart$NTA- She’s an adult just like you are. You have the right to say no and you know your own mother so you know you have to stand firm in your decision. I think it’s kind of you to offer to teach her! Plus it will greatly benefit her in the long run to learn how to live on her own! :-)$newcomment$9. u/Prangelina: $commentstart$NTA, living with an alcoholic would be pure hell. And you are right about the basic skills. It is not your problem to solve. Stay firm.

And tell your aunties they can take her in if they think that it is so easy and a duty of a relative.$newcomment$10. u/TemporaryBuy4751: $commentstart$NTA. she’s an alcoholic and a leech. she could look after herself if she wanted but she’s comfortable in her so called incompetence.",2023-04-02 18:22:19,23/100

Especially if there's a lot of going between inside and outside. 

Small get-togethers, like with 5 or so friends, usually shoes off. But if you're not sure, you can just follow the lead of the person whose house you're at. Or just ask.

Some people care, some don't. Some of my family likes shoes off and some of my family doesn't care.$newcomment$4. u/Time4Tigers: $commentstart$I typically ask! At home, I usually don't think about it much, but I like to be respectful of others.$newcomment$5. u/Swrdmn: $commentstart$When I walk into a house I’ve been invited too I immediately urinate on the corner closest to the door. This act claims the house as my territory and thus gives me supreme authority over the entire dwelling.

Often there's a shoe rack or a bunch of shoes on the mat near the front door if it's a no-shoe house so I take that as a hint and follow what everyone else does. If there's no such thing, then shoes on, though I personally prefer to take my shoes off and just wear socks.$newcomment$9. u/jessper17: $commentstart$I ask.  If they want them off, I take them off.  I’m inclined to do that anyway as we don’t wear shoes in the house at home.$newcomment$10. u/Bluemonogi: $commentstart$I would keep my shoes on unless my shoes were wet/messy or they request no shoes. It is not something I am opposed to doing usually but I'm not going to fling my shoes off automatically. People who want no shoes generally make their wishes clear.",2023-04-02 20:18:23,7/100
74,AmItheAsshole,Story,AITA for not standing up for my sister when she was excluded from my grandma's party?,grandmapartyproblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12994z5/aita_for_not_standing_up_for_my_sister_when_she/,12994z5,"I recently helped my grandma throw a party honoring what would've been her and my grandfather's 60th anniversary. He passed three years ago, and my uncle and cousin died around the same time. Both were married and my grandma decided to pay respect to their relationships as well, by including them in a slideshow and having their spouses sit with her. I thought this was a great idea, but I suggested that she include my sister too, as her husband died in November. My grandma refused though, saying it wasn't the same because my sister is young (29) and had only been married for two years. 

I definitely felt this would hurt my sister's feelings, so after some discussion, my grandma decided to just exclude her from the party. I wasn't 100% sure this was the right course of action, but my sister is still grieving, and I figured there was a chance she would skip the event, so I agreed.

My sister found out and she's very upset. She thinks our grandma is an asshole for excluding her and thinking she's not a real widow. But she's madder at me for not standing up for her. She thinks I should've quit and told grandma to throw the party on her own, or even went ahead and made a slideshow for her without telling grandma. I really wanted her to be included, but I also wanted to respect my grandmother's wishes and honor my grandpa.",2023-04-02 21:53:05,33/100

Size, shape, circumcision, the whole thing.$newcomment$2. u/Oneofthemuse: $commentstart$Literally everything, they know from what I dreamt about last night, to my period cycles. Friendships with other women are amazing$newcomment$3. u/chaosindeep: $commentstart$I know most the details on many of her sexual partners, play by play of her recent sexual experiences, her trauma and how that impacted sex for her for a long time vs how it does now, how often she throws up while giving head, hell I know half of what her gynecologists have said to her and vice versa. The first time I hooked up with an uncircumcised guy, I *immediately* convened the council for wisdom and guidance as well as a recount of my observations and thoughts

Women are often detail oriented story tellers, and with other women we can debrief it all without them interjecting to ask what this detail or that has to do with the main story; its *all* the story. Whereas men are often (but not always) more generalized and succinct in recounting things to one another$newcomment$4. u/crystal_starr: $commentstart$We know everything about each other.$newcomment$5. u/Cristalita11: $commentstart$When I had a group of girl friends back in high school I had seen them naked and knew when they had done something sexual with a guy and how big his dick was (not all true for all of the girls, each shared different things).$newcomment$6. u/Cherry_Joy: $commentstart$It depends on the girls. I have some girl friends who love tea time, and it'll be an entire afternoon dedicated to filling in our friend group on every small detail about their guy's dick: size, veins, freckles, bumps, birthmarks, hair, cut/uncut, length, girth, which direction it's curved in, etc. On top of that, we'll have cartoon nicknames for all of them based on the faces and sounds they make when they finish. I know how they met, what they liked about the guy initially, what red flags he's showing, what he does, how he treats them. For SOME of my friends, I end up knowing their boyfriends and husbands as well as I know my own.   


Then I have some friends who keep it all or most of it to themselves. They respect their partner's privacy. They also understand that most of the time when we're dishing, it's venting, which people only do when there's something on their minds, right? But when that's all your friends hear, it starts to seem like your partner is trash. Cut to when you need actual advice, all your friends are too busy telling you to throw the whole man out to actually listen and help you out.   


When I was in high school, I loved tea time. Unfortunately, I met my husband in high school, so a lot of my friends that I still have from high school do have intimate knowledge of him. I learned the lesson when we had our first baby that venting might feel cathartic at the time, but it bites you in the \*ss eventually. Any friends I've made in the last 5 years only know that I love him and that he's not perfect but he's an amazing father and I couldn't picture life without him.

I'm a vet tech who just recently got hired on at a sanctuary after leaving a zoo hospital. I wasn't quite expecting to find myself working with a narcissistic vet, but here we are.

I had to go to HR and a couple of bosses regarding a couple of things she did and then asked me to do. 

Backstory: A ton of our horses have had diarrhea for a few months, vet prescribes a ton of meds and it's a horrible inefficient mess for the equine team, to the point where the three keepers they have are absolutely drowning and having to stay very late every day. 

Situation: I asked the equine team lead if she'd like me to come in to help on my day off, she loved the idea and I ran it by my boss, who said no (reason given was end of pay period and no available in lieu of day to make up for it, despite me being able to get OT). I inform the equine team lead, she takes it to my boss's boss who overrides the decision.

Later that day, she calls me over the radio in a very frantic voice telling me I need to come to the hospital. I, in a moment of frustrated stupidity, text my coworker who's at the hospital. Turns out our boss was using said coworker's phone to speak with someone and saw my initial text and decided to impersonate my coworker, after which I complained about her calling me over to the hospital. 

She then tells me to take Monday off for working that day, and we'll have a meeting on Tuesday. 

I immediately call her boss and HR, explain the situation. I am advised by a keeper who was present at the time to call her boss's boss about the manipulating the time sheet thing, which I also do. Her boss's boss tells me I have to come in on Monday per my normal schedule and the time sheet cannot be manipulated like that. 

Coworker tells me today that she thinks it was wrong of me to go to HR and the bosses about coming in today, because now instead of her getting over it after the meeting it's going to turn into a whole big thing. 

Was I in the wrong? Did I stir the pot a bit too much, however unintentionally and despite making an initial dumb decision to text a coworker? 

I can give more info if needed, this was very summarized.",2023-04-03 20:46:54,4/100
